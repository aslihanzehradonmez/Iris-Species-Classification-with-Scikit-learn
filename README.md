# Iris Species Classification with Scikit-learn: A Comparative Performance Analysis of Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, SVM, and KNN Models 📊

This project focuses on classifying Iris flower species using the classic Iris dataset. It implements and compares Scikit-learn's machine learning algorithms: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).

## ✨ Key Features

* 🧠 **Multiple Models Implemented:** Explores Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, SVM, and KNN for classification.
* 🌸 **Classic Dataset:** Utilizes the standard Iris dataset from `sklearn.datasets`.
* 🛠️ **Data Preprocessing:** Includes essential steps like train-test splitting and feature scaling (StandardScaler).
* 💪 **Model Optimization:** Employs `GridSearchCV` for hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation to enhance performance and prevent overfitting.
* 📊 **Performance Comparison:** Evaluates and contrasts the test accuracy of the tuned models.
* 📈 **Visualizations:** Features a pair plot for exploratory data analysis and a bar plot to compare model performances.
